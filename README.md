# Brewery-Finder

This brewery map started out as a project for a Javascript class I was taking. I'm a homebrewer and a fan of going to 
breweries in any town I'm in. I have big plans for this project, including a full product spec. I'll continue to tinker 
with it when I can. It is currently a bit clunky as I add in functionality that will allow the user to search by 
state to see breweries, rather than having to use the search box to find specific breweries.
